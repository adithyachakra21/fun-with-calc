Adithya here!

In the fun-with-calc repository, I aim to store all the MATLAB functions that I've made so far. This list is a work in progress, so I hope to add more as time goes on. Here's what I got so far:

1) Numerical Integration with Left-Hand, Right-Hand, and Trapezoidal Approximation
2) Euler's Method of Approximating a Function
3) Improved Euler's Method of Approximating a Function
